# Concepts

## Short-circuit Evaluation
In any line that evaluates multiple conditions, JS does its best to short-
circuit what needs to be evaluated.

```JavaScript
// LHS is evaluated and returned as true (RHS ignored)
console.log("me" || "you");

// 1st condition evaluated as false yields third condition evaluation & return
// (returns true due to two true expressions "you" and "you")
console.log(0 ? ("me || me") : ("you" && "you"))
```

## Automatic Type Conversion (Via Type Coercion)
JS does its best to allow any types to be compared and returned. Its interpreter
performs _type coercion_ on the values it is "confused" about.

```JavaScript
console.log(8 * null);  // converts null to 0, returns 0
console.log("5" - 1);   // converts "5" to 5, returns 4
console.log("5" + 1);   // converts 1 to "1", returns "51"
console.log("five" * 2);// cannot perform conversion on "five", returns NaN
```

Note that the type coercion being performed is heavily dependent on the
_operation_; The values being evaluated and converted are secondary in
comparison.

## Variables & Data Binding
There are three keywords that represent assigning a value to a variable:
1. _var_ - allows for defining a global variable. When _var_ is used in the context of a local block, the associated variable can be accessed outside said block.
2. _let_ - introduced in ES2015. Allows for defining a local variable whose scope is exactly the block it belongs to.
3. _const_ - when used in assignment, behaves like _final_ in Java. The associated variables behave just like variables defined with _let_, only they cannot be modified at all in the future.
