I know next to nothing about raspberries or the agriculture behind them. What I do know is that at certain times of the year, the organic raspberries at my local
~~grocery store~~ supermarket look like somebody squeezed them through a wet sock before putting them in the container they are sold in. Their non-organic counterparts
sit close by, proudly flaunting their dark reds, thick drupelets, and overall enormity.

### Assumptions

The non-organic raspberries are in better shape, because they're either:

- More prominently genetically modified
- Grown in environments with higher pest control

Either way, I'm ignorant
