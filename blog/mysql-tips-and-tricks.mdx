# MySQL - Helpful Tidbits

My experiences at Rev360 (RevolutionEHR) and Mercato brought about developing for back-ends that leverage MySQL for data storage solutions. All my other previous experiences were within the context of Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server database technologies, and I found myself constantly Googling to see how to do things better in MySQL. Below are some of those findings.

### Perform batch UPDATEs with a temp table

When performing `UPDATE`s against a table in bulk, MySQL is pretty non-performant when given a raw ```UPDATE``` statement with a ```WHERE``` clause:

```sql
UPDATE A
SET foo = 'bar' WHERE id < 1000;
```

The best way of handling bulk ```UPDATE```s turns out to be establishing a temp table containing the values that encapsulate the data for the ```UPDATE```, and then performing the ```UPDATE``` with a ```JOIN``` against the temporary table.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `tempFooValues`;

CREATE TABLE `tempFooValues` (
`id` INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
`foo` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
);

INSERT INTO tempFooValues (id, foo) VALUES
(1, 'bar'),
(2, 'bar'),
...,
...,
(1000, 'bar');

UPDATE A
INNER JOIN tempFooValues ON tempFooValues.id = A.id
SET
A.foo = tempFooValues.foo;
```

### Leveraging CASE within a JOIN

This one is pretty self-explanatory...

```sql
SELECT * FROM A
JOIN B
ON CASE
WHEN B.type IN (1, 3) AND B.a_id = A.id THEN 1
WHEN B.type IN (2) AND B.other_id = A.other_id THEN 1
ELSE 0
END = 1;
```

### Converting Timezones from UTC

The arguments for the "from" and "to" timezones in `CONVERT_TZ` are the offsets from
UTC. Therefore, `+00:00` is itself UTC, and `-07:00` would equate to PT in the U.S.

```sql
SELECT CONVERT_TZ(created, '+00:00','-07:00') FROM users;
```
