# 2023

Year of the doing.

Shamelessly inspired by Lex Fridman, I have decided to attempt to read a book a week in the **Year of doing**.
I just so happened to catch this goal of his after recently starting to read again. I find myself in the middle of
Philip K. Dick's *The Man in the High Castle*, while in the same position of the first week of the new year. I'm
more confident about a personal goal than I've been in a long time, as well. I assume it's because I have yet to, and
plan not to tell anyone about said goal.

## Book 1: *The Man in the High Castle*

New vocabulary words:
- ingratiating: intended to get approval or favor; sycophantic
- hegemony: leadership or dominance, usually with respect to one country's power or influence over another or others
- adroitly: in a clever or skillful way
