# Notes

## Data Types
* Numbers - You know, the ususal. (40, 1.3, 6969696...)
```ruby
x = 3
y = 2.9
```

* Strings - Again, do we need to go over this? ("Steve", "is", "dumb"...)
```ruby
name = "steebe"
```

* Booleans
```ruby
5 < 10          # => true
5     <= 10     # => true
'abc' == 'def'  # => false
true            # => true
123456          # => true
0               # => true
nil             # => false
'xyz'.empty?    # => false
'a' > 5         # => error:
# comparison of String with
# Numeric failed
```

* Arrays - A list of items whose initial value is denoted with brackets ([]) (index access similar to Python => arr[0] returns the first item of arr)
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]
```

* Hashes - A map; a list of key value pairs (similar to Python dict)
```ruby
h = "key" => "value", "name" => "steebe"
```
* Symbols - A static constant of sorts. The syntax of a symbol in code is _:<symbol-name>_ (:symbolA, :mysymbol, :etc). The symbol can be reused over and over, and memory is only allocated once for its representation. Its underlying representation, by the way, is a string when it is consumed.
```ruby
:mySym
puts :mySym # => mySym
```

## Blocks
In Ruby, any code contained within curly braces is considered a block. Blocks are special, because they are often invoked by a function. The invoker is responsible for sending any values to the block in the form of a variable. For example:

Note that the variable is passed into the block in a parameter list encapsulated in pipes. Any multi-parameter implementation is comma separated.

## String Formatting
In the context of processing strings or printing to them to the console, Ruby offers a convention that helps with formatting and dealing with expressions as strings.

Within double quotes, the hash sign followed by a pair of curly braces denotes accessing a value. The contents within the curly braces must be a variable or expression that represents a string.

## Functions
Functions (inherently "methods" due to being defined within a class body) can be called from any object in Ruby, but only certain methods work on certain objects.
Functions can require parameters, and upon invocation _optional_ parameters denoting the argument list.

```ruby
x = "Hello!"
y = x.gsub("lo", "p")
z = x.gsub "lo", "p"
puts y      # => Help!
puts (z)    # => Help!
```

### Out of the Box Functions

| Function            | Caller Type(s) | Notes                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _puts_              | System         | Put "arg" prints its argument to the screen followed by a newline.                                                                   |
| _print_             | System         | Prints its argument to the screen.                                                                                                   |
| _.times_            | Number         | Iterates for a cycle whose count is **n**, the number being invoked on. If followed by a block, will execute that block **n** times. |
| _.length_           | String         | Prints the length of a string. Does not work on numbers!                                                                             |
| _.gsub(arg1, arg2)_ | String         | "Global Substitute" replaces all instances of arg1 in the String with arg2.                                                          |
| _.lines_            | String         | Converts a string to an array of its contents. Each item represents a block of characters that are followed by a newline.            |
| _.ljust(intArg)_    | String         | When called on a string, justifies the string to the left side of the buffer with its argument specifying the amount of padding.     |
| _.reverse_          | String, Array  | Reverses the attributes of an object. Does not work on numbers!                                                                      |
| _.max_              | Array          | Prints the greatest item of an array of numbers.                                                                                     |
| _.sort_             | Array          | Sorts the contents of an array of numbers.                                                                                           |
| _.join(delimiter)_  | Array          | Joins the contents of an array with the delimiter as the separators between each item.                                               |
| _.each_             | Array, Hash    | Returns the contents of an array or the key/value pairs of a hash.                                                                   |
| _.select_           | Array, Hash    | Returns the contents of an array or hash filtered by a block.                                                                        |
| _.count_            | Array, Hash    | Returns the amount of elements in an array or hash.                                                                                  |
| _.keys_             | Hash           | Prints the keyset of a Hash as an array.                                                                                             |
| _.to_s_             |                | Attempts to convert a non-string to a string.                                                                                        |

### Definitions
As with any robust high level language, Ruby allows for the developer to create their own methods. To create a method in Ruby, the _def_ and _end_ keywords are required to form a block.
```ruby
def myMethod (arg1)
# method body
end
```

### Returns
A custom method does not include its return type in its stub. Instead, it just returns what it must when it must. The return statement can include the _return_ keyword, or it can simply be the value that is being returned. In other words, the _return_ keyword is optional.

### Bang! (!)
```ruby
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers   # => [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers.sort
numbers   # => [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers.sort!
numbers   # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 66]
```
