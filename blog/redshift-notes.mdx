Below are helpful commands I don't want to forget for Redshift admin and use. Those interested in a small torching
of Redshift as a product are welcome to read the [sibling post](./redshift-opinion).

## Querying

### A Distinct "`DISTINCT`"

**PostgreSQL** users might be familiar with the ability to use `DISTINCT` as an expression evaluator, rather
than a clause, to reduce the result set down to records that only include the value evaluated by the
expression.

**MySQL** users might be used to leveraging `GROUP BY` in a different way than normal
to do the same.

I.E: if I have a table, `orders`:
<table border={1} frame={"outside"}>
    <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>customerId</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td>1</td>
       <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Our first customer was keeping the lights on, and proved that the `orders` table has a many:one
relationship with the `customers` table.

Suppose we need to pull the latest order for each customer, in a world where there is not just
a sole customer placing orders. Additionally, the context of the report involves many other fields are being
aggregated across dozens of other tables. `LIMIT 1` is not coming to the rescue.

Postgres allows for:
```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT ON(customerId) customerId,
    id
FROM orders
ORDER BY customerId, id DESC;
```

Okay, cool. Weird, but cool. The developer specifies they _only_ want unique `customerId` values
in their results, but want the respective order information along with it. Postgres constructs
groups based on the argument provided to `DISTINCT ON`, then omits any records that break the unique
value specified. The `ORDER BY` gives the developer control over precedence on which distinct records
to honor.

MySQL perhaps helps visualize this better, literally making the developer create the groups themselves:
`ORDER BY`:
```sql
WITH disctinct_customer_id_orders AS (
    SELECT
        id
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customerId
)
SELECT * FROM distinct_customer_id_orders ORDER BY id DESC;
```

It's still not perfect, either, because the `ORDER BY` should happen in the first query, but hey, MySQL tries.

#### Redshift does neither...

...yet I don't hate how Redshift achieves the same outcome, strictly from the developer
experience side of things:
```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        customerId,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customerId ORDER BY id DESC) AS customer_id_rank
    FROM orders
) as ranked_orders
WHERE ranked_orders.customer_id_rank = 1;
```

Where Redshift could have continued reinventing an already finished, rehashed,
re-spoked wheel of relational-algebra powered query engines, it instead took the modest route.

The developer is welcome to rewrite `GROUP BY` on Amazon's behalf. Also, the developer gets a bonus
column in their toolkit to play with. It's okay that the result set grew though, because it's powered
by a warehouse meant for Big Data!

## Administering

### Groups & Users
```sql
-- Create groups
CREATE GROUP MY_GROUP [WITH USER (user1, user2,...)];

-- View all user groups (as cluster admin)
SELECT * from PG_GROUP;

-- View all users in a group
SELECT usename FROM pg_user, pg_group
WHERE pg_user.usesysid = ANY(pg_group.grolist)
  AND pg_group.groname = '<group-name>';

-- Apply to entire schema
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA my_schema TO GROUP my_group;

-- Apply to specific tables
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE my_table TO my_user;

-- Apply read-only access to specific (or all) tables in a single schema
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA my_schema TO my_user;

-- Create user
CREATE USER my_user PASSWORD '<pass-string>';

-- Create user under specific group
CREATE USER my_user IN GROUP my_group PASSWORD 'pass';

-- Alter existing user
ALTER USER my_user PASSWORD 'new-pass';
```

### Cluster Metadata
```sql
-- View tables within a Schema
select distinct tablename from pg_table_def where schemaname = '<schema-name>';

-- View all schemas in a cluster
select * from pg_namespace;

-- View connection activity within a cluster
select * from stl_connection_log
where recordtime > '2021-02-07 00:00:00' and username in ('user1', 'user2')
order by recordtime DESC;
```
