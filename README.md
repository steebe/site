### Diary

After many months since switching to Gatsby from a [pure HTML site](https://github.com/steebe/site-archive) with a
basic sibling [Jekyll blog](https://github.com/steebe/steebe.github.io), I decided to keep my React chops up by giving
Gatsby a try. I have been fortunate enough to have received some experience with Next.js. First on a side project, and
then at work. My experience with Vercel's baby exposed me to the overarching JavaScript/TypeScript community more than I
appreciated at the time, and I built a fairly foundational awareness of the alternative and up-and-coming frameworks and
tools such as Gatsby and Svelte.

I was aware of Gatsby's potential. Raw power, fueled by GraphQL and a ferocious community. Power that promised a simple
development experience for a complex and capable result: a static site on steroids.

Perhaps it was my stellar experience working with Next.js that got my hopes up for Gatsby, but I was shocked at a few
attributes I noticed out of the gate:

- Complex
  - The docs to get things off the ground were (at the time, with Gatsby v4) absolutely massive. Nothing was simple.
- Scattered
  - For a framework that claims to offer so much, its functionality sure seemed to not be in one place. Plugins galore
    power this beast.
- Ever breaking
  - Each major release (and yes, I understand the point of marking a release as "major", thank you) contains massive
    breaking changes. The more plugins you use for functionality that's core to Gatsby, the longer it will take to address
    such changes.
- Not my job
  - I've encountered a few scenarios, mostly within the "getting started" guides or upgrade guides, in which the author
    of the guide offered no tangible understanding to a step or workaround, and rather linked to a library or listed steps
    provided by a community developer. Obviously, that's how the realm of programming gets things done in general (on top of
    existing solutions), it just feels lazy that a guide would be a place where an author cops out.
